# onchain-lottery

1. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network that runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. Learn how to [customize your network configuration](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/quick-start/environment#1-initialize-a-local-blockchain).

2. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. You can find more information about how to customize your contract and deployment script in our [documentation](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/quick-start/environment#2-deploy-your-smart-contract).

3. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.
